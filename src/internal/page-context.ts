/**
 * Page Context Management for Schema Validation UI
 *
 * This module provides a way to capture and retrieve the Playwright page context
 * for use in standalone functions that need UI display capabilities.
 *
 * Similar to captureTestContext, this allows the plain validateSchema function
 * to display validation results in the Playwright UI.
 *
 * @note Test Isolation: Playwright runs parallel tests in separate worker processes,
 * so global state is isolated per-worker. Serial tests in the same worker are handled
 * by the fixtures which call clearPageContext() after each test. For manual usage
 * outside of fixtures, ensure you're in an isolated test context.

 * ```ts
 * import { test } from '@playwright/test'

 *
 * test.beforeEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
 *   captureTestContext(testInfo)
